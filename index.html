    <p>DESI GHEE is perhaps the most ancient source of elixir on mother Earth. This is why Desi Ghee has a dominant place in healing and rejuvenation in Ayurveda.</p>
    <p>There are two types of Desi Ghee mentioned in Ayurvedic texts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ghee made from butter/cream:</strong>Ghee made from butter may increase our body fat and thereby, the Cholesterol level.</li>
      <li><strong>Ghee made from curd:</strong>Ghee made from curd contains healthy fats which nourish our tissues and decrease the Cholesterol level.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p><strong>THE DIFFERENCE IS THE PROCESS: BILONA – CHURNING OF CURD</strong></p>
    <p>Churning Process in making Ghee is seldom practiced now-a-days as it is time-consuming and costly. But then, it gives tremendous VALUE ADDITION to the quality.</p>
    <p><strong>'MOHAN GHEE' IS MADE BY CHURNING THE CURD</strong></p>
    <p>The process generates a naturally self developed UNIQUE AROMATIC FLAVOUR and texture. Moreover, since in this process, it is the curd being formed by human friendly bacteria, it digests easily in the human system providing more oxygen to the blood which is excellent for brain development in kids, pregnant and lactating women, the elderly and the young.</p>
    <p><strong>‘MOHAN GHEE’ A PREVENTIVE AND CURATIVE 'SUPER-FOOD’</strong></p>
    <p>Curd based Desi bilona Ghee has a broad spectrum of medicinal, cosmetic and health benefits.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It’s regular consumption in moderate quantity, increases the body resistance for various infections and diseases by boosting the immune system.</li>
      <li>It aids in digestion, and  balances hormones of the body.</li>
      <li>It is rich in vitamin A and E which help improve eyesight and skin texture.</li>
      <li>It is rich in Omega-3 Fatty acids which are known to reduce bad Cholesterol and BOOST HEART HEALTH.</li>
      <li>Curd based Desi Ghee is rich in Conjugated Linoleic acid (CLA), a Fatty acid that protects against Plaque deposits in the arteries, Cancer and Diabetes.</li>
      <li>It lubricates the joints, promotes flexibility and also has anti-viral properties which come from its Butyric acid content.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Perhaps the most important feature of 'MOHAN GHEE' which is made through this traditional VEDIC PROCESS is that, it retains its pro-biotic properties, provides nourishment to the entire body and also helps rejuvenate the self ...
      THE BODY AND THE SOUL...</p>
    <p>MOHAN GHEE has been winning trust of consumers for more than seven Decades, as Pure Desi Ghee of
      UNMATCHABLE PURITY AND QUALITY.....</p>

    <h3>Advantages of Ghee</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Ghee is all-natural.</li>
      <p>
        Ghee is free of potentially unhealthy additives, preservatives and trans fats. Thanks to its pure form and low moisture content, ghee is shelf-stable and can stay fresh for up to a year without refrigeration. While it's not an application for
        the general public, some families in India have aged ghee that has lasted more than 100 years.
      </p>
      <li>Ghee reduces your exposure to cancer-causing agents.</li>
      <p>
        At high temperatures, most oils break down into unstable elements known as free radicals. Excessive amounts of free radicals in the body can result in cell damage, including the development of cancer. Ghee has a smoking point of nearly 500°F,
        so it retains its structural integrity under the high heat used for frying and other preparation methods.
      </p>
      <li>Ghee is a rich source of antioxidants.</li>
      <p>
        Antioxidants act as “scavengers” in the body, seeking out and neutralizing free radicals to prevent cell and tissue damage that can lead to disease. Ghee contains vitamin E, one of the most powerful antioxidants found in food.
      </p>
      <li>Ghee contains cancer-fighting CLA.</li>
      <p>
        When ghee is made from butter derived from grass-fed cows, it contains stores of conjugated linoleic acid.CLA has been found to combat cancer as well as cardiovascular disease. Some studies have also suggested a link between <a
          href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16924272#sthash.x5WD6IAO.dpuf">CLA and weight loss.</a>
      </p>
      <li>Ghee helps moisturize dry skin and hair.</li>
      <p>
        Ghee isn’t used just for cooking. It has long been used by Indian women as a topical moisturizer to relieve dry complexions. Application on the scalp also fights dryness and encourages the growth of thick, lustrous hair.
      </p>
      <li>Ghee has anti-inflammatory properties.</li>
      <p>
        Ayurvedic medicine has regularly used ghee to treat burns and swelling. It contains large quantities of butyrate, a fatty acid that has been linked to an immune system response that soothes inflammation. The substance also has anti-viral
        properties and contributes to a healthy digestive system by helping heal and repair the stomach lining. This can be particularly valuable for individuals with intestinal disorders like Crohn’s disease.
      </p>
      <li>Ghee contains heart-healthy fats.</li>
      <p>
        While ghee has a high concentration of fat, it’s high in monounsaturated Omega-3s. These are the same fatty acids found in foods like salmon that have been discovered to promote a healthy heart and cardiovascular system. A study conducted on
        men in a rural area of India found that those who consumed larger quantities of ghee had a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3215354/#sthash.x5WD6IAO.dpuf">lower incidence of coronary heart disease</a> and reduced levels
        of
        serum cholesterol.
      </p>
      <li>Ghee is a viable alternative for individuals with dairy allergies.</li>
      <p>
        Since ghee is formed by removing milk solids, it contains only trace amounts of milk sugars (lactose) and proteins (casein), making it suitable for most people with dairy allergies. Ghee also fits into the popular Paleo diet, which is based
        on
        the types of foods eaten by early humans and excludes dairy products.
      </p>
      <li>Ghee is a nutritional powerhouse.</li>
      <p>
        Ghee contains plentiful amounts of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K. These nutrients are essential to a wide range of body functions from the brain to the immune system. In addition, ghee aids in the body’s absorption of fat-soluble
        vitamins
        and minerals from other foods.
